There are quite a few other Arduino STM32 projects, some of which may be beneficial to this project or anyone using this project


[https://github.com/BestU/STM32_for_Arduino_BSP](https://github.com/BestU/STM32_for_Arduino_BSP)
 New in as of December 2014. Appears only to support STM32F051C8T6. I'm not sure if there is support for SPI or I2C

[https://github.com/MakerLabMe/STM32_Arduino_Cores](https://github.com/MakerLabMe/STM32_Arduino_Cores). Seems to have been abandoned. I tried to contact the author via a GitHub issue at the beginning of December 2014 but have not had a reply.

[https://github.com/avikde/koduino](https://github.com/avikde/koduino) New development to GitHub at the start of December 2014. Currently only supports STM32F3xx series. There is intended support for STM32F4xxg .
Looks to be one to watch.

[https://github.com/leaflabs/libmaple](https://github.com/leaflabs/libmaple) the original source for this project. Still gets occasional updates. As far as I'm aware the author (Marti) plans support for STM32F4xx at some time, however as far as I can tell it still uses the old Arduino API 0022 and hence won't work with most current Arduino code.
