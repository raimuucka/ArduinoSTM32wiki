This project is based on Libmaple developed by LeafLabs for their Maple and Maple mini products, which used a modified version of the Arduino 0022 IDE. LibMaple is still available on GitHub, and the original Maple IDE is available on the Leaflabs website and via GitHub [LibMaple](https://github.com/leaflabs/libmaple)

The initial conversion of LibMaple to comply with the Arduino 1.5 Third party hardware specification was done by Bob Cousins and is available on GitHub as [Maple-asp](https://github.com/bobc/maple-asp)

Further work has subsequently been done my Bob to remove code duplication

Microduino support has been provided by Ian Hawkin
