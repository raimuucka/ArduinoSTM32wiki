#####Arduino STM32 adds the ability to develop for STM32F103 based boards, including the Maple and Maple mini using the Arduino 1.6.1 IDE

There is also experimental support for STM32F3 and STM32F4, however code for both of these devices is in early stages of development / porting, and only the STM32F1 is close to full support for the Arduino 1.0 API (and mostly compliant with the Arduino 1.6.x API)
