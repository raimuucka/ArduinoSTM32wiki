The repo now contains provisional support for the STM Nucleo F103RB

This is currently a work in progress by Matthias on the Arduino forum

Currently only GPIO is known to definitely work, however Serial 1 should redirect to the virtual com port that is part of the Nucleo drivers package.

Upload is via the STLink co-processor on the Nucleo board.
