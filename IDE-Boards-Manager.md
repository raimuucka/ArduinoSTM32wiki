Arduino IDE 1.6.2 is considerably different from previous versions, as it no longer bundles the ARM compiler which the STM32 uses.

The ARM compiler can be installed using the new Boards Manager, feature (available on the Tools menu)

To install the ARM compiler you need to install the Arduino Due board.

Once this is installed, this repo should work for STM32F1  based boards.
