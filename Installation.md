####Windows 

* Download and install the latest stable version of the Arduino Beta from [here](http://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.6.0rc1-windows.exe)
* Download zip file containing the STM32 files from [here](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/archive/master.zip)
* Unzip to create the Arduino_STM32 folder
* Copy the Arduino_STM32 folder to My Documents/Arduino/hardware
* Start the Arduino IDE, and select the appropriate board from the Tools -> Board menu, and select the appropriate Com port.

Windows users can also watch [this video I did on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zwGnytGT8M), it refers to version 1.5.8 of the IDE, which was the current version when I did the video, however its equally applicable to 1.6.rc1 except the download location for the IDE is different.
